# Queue with 2 stacks

**Forward Stack** push the enqueued elements. Enqueue operations will be always performed on forward stack

**Reverse Stack** holds the elements in reversed order. All dequeue opperations wil be performed
on reverse stack.

# Performance analysis

All engueus and dequeus are O(1)

No elements is push more then twice.

No elements is poped more then twice.

Time complexity is **O(M)**  where M is a number of operations we perform we perform on the queue.
