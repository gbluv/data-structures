# Data Structures: Queue

A queue is a data structure where you add elements to the end of the queue
and remove from the beginning of the queue. 


**LILO** - Last in Last Out. Last one added to the queue will be
last one out.

**FIFO** - First In first out. This of it as a line to the checkout counter.

**Enqueue** - adding element to the end of the queue.

**Dequeue** - removing element from the end of the queue.

**PEEk** - to see first element in the queue

**Offer** - adds to the queue if space is available (JAVA only, not a standard method)

**isEmpty** - check if queue is empty

A common data structure used for that is a circular queue with pointers to the head and to the tail


# Performance and complexity

**Enqueuing and Dequeuing** Will have order complexity of 1

**isEmpty or isFull** will also have order complexity of 1

**Space complexity** will be O(N)
